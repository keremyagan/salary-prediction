Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

I got "Salaries.csv" from Kaggle. 

I've done some adjustment on Classifier Tools to find best result .

I've used "accuracy_score" to see quality of prediction.

You can find best results each method in "salariesupdated.py". I've used GridSearchCV to improve results.
